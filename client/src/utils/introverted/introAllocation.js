Imagine you’re about to graduate and are considering various options for your future—whether it's pursuing further studies abroad, relocating to another city for work, starting to build up your savings, or gradually repaying your student loans. 
In any case, you hope your financial situation can provide stable and secure support for your life plans over the next few years.

At this moment, you have NT$1,000,000 in investable funds. This amount may come from savings or family support, and it represents a long-term asset that should be managed with care.

Investing is a decision that requires rational judgment, as each product carries different levels of risk and return. Some high-risk options may offer potential gains but also come with the possibility of losing your principal. In contrast, lower-risk options tend to provide more stable returns.

Now, based on your personal risk tolerance and future goals, please allocate this fund carefully. This is an important decision that will impact your future plans and financial stability, so we encourage you to approach each investment choice realistically.
