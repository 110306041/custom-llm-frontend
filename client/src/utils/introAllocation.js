Imagine this: you're about to graduate and are thinking aheadâ€”whether itâ€™s studying abroad, starting a new job in a different city, building your savings, or paying off student loans.  
You want your finances to be stable and secure enough to support your plans over the next few years.

You currently have NT$1,000,000 available to invest.  
This amount might come from savings or family support, and itâ€™s meant to be used thoughtfully for long-term growth.

Investing is all about balance. Some funds may offer high potential returns but come with greater risks, including the possibility of losing part of your principal. Others are more stable, offering lower but steadier returns.

Your task: carefully divide this NT$1,000,000 across one or more of the following fund options, based on your risk preference and financial goals.
